/*
 *   How we want effects to work:
 *		- An effect can have a unique source on an instance basis (player, allomantic grenade etc), rather than only allowing one instance of an effect at a time. This would let us stack effects, ie multiple people using copper clouds to prevent seekers finding a group.
 *		- An effect may have a ticking effect (like how regeneration works?)
 *		- An effect needs a timer, so we can set for how long it lasts for (it can be renewed as often as needed)
 *		- An effect should be able to have any number of attribute changes, and should clean up after itself when finished.
 *		- We don't want it to show up in jade tooltips
 *		- An effect should have a strength associated with it, so it knows how much to scale up the attribute changes, or be available for use with the ticking effect
 *
 *	Because of that, we can't use the vanilla mob effects at all
 *   Even specially separating it away from the list on living entities. Those effects will never allow a situation like above where I want
 *   players to be able to use multiple copper clouds together. Effects only let attributes benefit once per type of effect
 *
